#
# To get started using this file, just copy or rename it to
# forge.profile.properties and edit one or more of the paths below.
# 
# Normally, users will not need to do anything here.  Keeping the default paths
# is an easy way to make sure your Forge settings and data are kept safe when
# you upgrade Forge, even if you install to a different path or delete the
# entire Forge program directory.
#
# If you need to, though, you can use this file to set the locations that Forge
# will use to store your data.  If you specify a relative path in this file, it
# will be relative to the Forge program directory.


# This is where Forge will save your personal data, such as your saved decks,
# preferences, and quest progress.  If you want to back up your data or copy it
# to another computer, this is the directory to copy.  The default value is
# platform-specific, and may differ a bit from what is listed here if you have
# an older version of Windows:
#   Windows: %APPDATA%/Forge
#             (usually, C:/Users/<your username>/Application Data/Roaming/Forge)
#   OSX:   $HOME/Library/Application Support/Forge
#   Linux: $HOME/.forge
userDir=

# This is where forge will keep downloaded content, such as card pictures and
# updated price lists.  The default values are:
#   Windows: %LOCALAPPDATA%/Forge/Cache
#          (usually C:/Users/<your username>/Application Data/Local/Forge/Cache)
#   OSX:   $HOME/Library/Caches/Forge
#   Linux: $HOME/.cache/forge
cacheDir=

# This is where forge will download and/or look for card picture data.  The
# directory structure and filenames are the same as those used by Magic
# Workstation, and if you have both programs installed, you can share the same
# picture database between them.  The default value (for all plaforms) is:
#   <cacheDir>/pics/cards
cardPicsDir=
